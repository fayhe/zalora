a) What is the relation between Database, Schema, Tables, View in PostgreSQL / MySQL?
Database contains several schema. 
A schema is a collection of database objects, like tables and views.
Schema objects are the logical structures that directly refer to the database’s data.
A user is a name defined in the database that can connect to and access objects.
Schemas and users help database administrators manage database security.

For user, view is a safe way to retrieve data from table without knowing the structure of table.
Based on the real tables, view can be used as a logical table. 


b) What is the difference between a table and a view?
A table contains real data, a view is simply a SQL which has been saved in the database.
For user, view is a safe way to retrieve data from table without knowing the structure of table.
Based on the real tables, view can be used as a logical table.

       group by item_code

Write a query to get total number of visit over all Item_Codes for every year?.
