3. Bash scripting
a) Write a bash script for the below set of tasks:
[
- connect to ftp server (host=10.11.12.13 port=22 username=helloFTP password=world)
- download all files that have their name started with "webtrekk_marketing" into "home/Marketing Report/Data/"
- run ZMR.py which is located in "home/Marketing Report/Scripts/"
- run UpdateWebtrekk.sql which is located in "home/Marketing Report/Scripts/" on a PostgreSQL DB (host=10.11.12.13 port=5439 database=zalora username=helloDB password=world)
]


ftp -n<<!
open 10.11.12.13
user helloFTP world
binary
lcd /home/Marketing Report/Data/
prompt
mget webtrekk_marketing*
close
bye
!
~

python /home/Marketing Report/Scripts/ZMR.py
./home/Marketing Report/Scripts/UpdateWebtrekk.sql

How would you schedule the above as a cron job every day at 2.35am?

b) Have a look at the folder "/programming-tasks/bash/"
- Write a bash script to rename all files below from "zalora-*" to "Zalora-*"
- All Zalora-* files contain a single string: "this is a test." (with a new line at the end):
    Write a shell script to change the content of those files to all uppercase.
    Write a shell script to remove all dot character (.) within those files.

$ ls
